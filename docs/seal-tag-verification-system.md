# Seal Tag Verification System Specification

## 1. System Overview

The Seal Tag Verification System is designed to ensure secure transportation of materials between source and destination points. Each transport session (truck journey) utilizes unique seal tags to maintain chain of custody and prevent tampering.

## 2. Key Components

### 2.1 User Roles
- **Operator**: Creates sessions and registers seal tags at source
- **Guard**: Verifies seal tags at destination

### 2.2 Technical Components
- QR/Barcode scanning module (camera-based)
- Session management system
- Seal tag database
- Validation engine
- User interfaces for different roles

## 3. Workflow

### 3.1 Session Creation (Operator)
1. Operator initiates a new transport session
2. System assigns unique session ID to truck journey
3. Operator scans 30-40 seal tags via device camera
4. System validates each tag for uniqueness
5. If tag is already used, system displays "Tag ID already used"
6. Valid tags are registered to the current session
7. Session is activated once all tags are registered

### 3.2 Session Verification (Guard)
1. Guard selects active session to verify
2. Guard scans seal tags at destination
3. System matches tags against those registered for the session
4. System confirms validity of each tag
5. Any missing or unauthorized tags trigger security alerts
6. Session is marked complete when all tags are verified

## 4. Data Structure

### 4.1 Session Table
- SessionID (Primary Key)
- CreationDate
- OperatorID
- TruckID
- SourceLocation
- DestinationLocation
- Status (Created, Active, Completed)

### 4.2 SealTag Table
- TagID (Primary Key)
- SessionID (Foreign Key)
- Status (Registered, Verified)
- RegisteredTimestamp
- VerifiedTimestamp
- RegisteredBy
- VerifiedBy

## 5. Security Features

- Each seal tag is used only once across all sessions
- Real-time validation prevents duplicate tag usage
- Complete audit trail of tag registration and verification
- Role-based access control for operators and guards

## 6. Exception Handling

### 6.1 Damaged Tag Protocol
- Guard must capture photographic evidence of damaged tag before proceeding
- Supervisor authorization required for damaged tag exceptions
- System allows manual entry of partial tag information if visible
- Special status codes track these exceptions (e.g., "DAMAGED_VERIFIED")
- Notes field required to describe damage condition

### 6.2 Tag Replacement Process
- Physical damaged tags must be collected and retained
- System links original damaged tag ID with replacement tag ID
- Both IDs remain associated with the session in the database

### 6.3 Security Thresholds
- Maximum allowable damaged tags per session (5% or 2 tags, whichever is lower)
- Security review triggered automatically if threshold is exceeded
- Enhanced audit trail for all damage verification processes including:
  - Timestamps
  - Location data
  - Personnel involved
  - Photographic evidence

### 6.4 Offline Operation
- System provides limited offline functionality if network connectivity is lost
- Data synchronized when connection is restored
- Cached validation rules applied in offline mode
- Visual indicators show when system is operating offline

## 7. Implementation Considerations

### 7.1 Technology Stack
- Mobile-compatible web application or native mobile app
- Camera API for QR/barcode scanning
- Secure database for tag and session information
- Real-time validation APIs

### 7.2 Hardware Requirements
- Devices with camera capability
- Proper lighting for accurate tag scanning
- Network connectivity for real-time validation

## 8. Future Enhancements

- GPS integration for location verification
- Tamper-evident electronic seals
- Mobile notifications for status updates
- Integration with inventory management systems
- Advanced analytics and reporting dashboard
