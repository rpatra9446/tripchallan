# Session Details Page: Issues and Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines critical issues identified in the Session Details page, particularly related to data captured by Operators during trip creation that isn't properly displayed or stored. The document provides analysis and proposed solutions for each issue, which will serve as a guide for future improvements.

## Current Issues

### 1. Missing Registration Certificate (RC) Value

**Issue Description:**  
While operators enter a Registration Certificate value during trip creation, this text value doesn't appear in the Session Details page.

**Technical Analysis:**  
- The create form collects both `registrationCertificate` (text value) and `registrationCertificateDoc` (file)
- Only the document file appears to be stored/displayed properly
- The text value may not be properly passed through the API or stored in the database

**Impact:**  
Users cannot see the Registration Certificate number, which is critical for verification and reference purposes.

### 2. Missing Driver License Value

**Issue Description:**  
Similar to the RC issue, the Driver License number entered by operators isn't displayed in the Session Details page.

**Technical Analysis:**  
- The create form collects both `driverLicense` (text value) and `driverLicenseDoc` (file)
- Only the document file appears to be properly stored/displayed
- The text value may not be correctly passed through the API or stored in the database

**Impact:**  
Users cannot verify the Driver License number, which is important for compliance and identification purposes.

### 3. Missing Seal Tag Images

**Issue Description:**  
Seal tag images captured during trip creation aren't displayed in the Session Details page.

**Technical Analysis:**  
- The schema for `sealTags` includes an `imageUrl` or `imageData` field, but it may not be properly populated
- The current implementation in the Session Details page doesn't display these images
- There may be a disconnect between image capture and storage

**Current Schema (approximate):**
```typescript
sealTags?: { 
  id: string; 
  barcode: string; 
  method: string; 
  imageUrl?: string | null; // May not be populated correctly
  createdAt: string; 
}[];
```

**Impact:**  
Users cannot visually verify seal tags, undermining the security and verification purpose of image capture.

### 4. Identical Timestamps for All Seal Tags

**Issue Description:**  
All seal tags show the same creation timestamp, despite being entered sequentially.

**Technical Analysis:**  
- This suggests a batch processing issue where all tags are given the same timestamp
- The frontend correctly captures individual timestamps, but they may be overwritten during API processing
- The database may be storing the session creation time rather than individual seal tag timestamps

**Impact:**  
This creates confusion about the sequence of operations and makes it difficult to audit the seal tag application process.

### 5. Generic "Operator" Label Instead of Operator Name

**Issue Description:**  
The "Scanned By" column shows "Operator" instead of the actual operator's name.

**Technical Analysis:**  
- The schema doesn't appear to store the operator's name with each seal tag
- This represents a critical data gap for audit and verification purposes
- The operator ID may be stored, but the name isn't being retrieved or displayed

**Impact:**  
This reduces accountability and makes it difficult to trace who performed specific actions.

### 6. Missing Export to PDF Functionality for Non-Employee Users

**Issue Description:**  
Non-employee users don't have access to an export to PDF functionality for session details.

**Technical Analysis:**  
- The application includes the jsPDF library, but the PDF export functionality may be limited to certain user roles
- There's no clear UI element for non-employee users to export session details

**Impact:**  
Non-employee users cannot generate documentation for their records or share session details in a standardized format.

## Proposed Solutions

### Schema Changes

1. **Update SealTags Schema:**
   ```typescript
   sealTags?: { 
     id: string; 
     barcode: string; 
     method: string; 
     imageUrl?: string | null;
     imageData?: string | null;  // Store base64 image data if needed
     createdAt: string;
     scannedById: string;        // Add this field
     scannedByName: string;      // Add this field
   }[];
   ```

2. **Ensure TripDetails Schema Includes:**
   ```typescript
   tripDetails?: {
     // Existing fields
     registrationCertificate: string;  // Ensure this is stored
     driverLicense: string;            // Ensure this is stored
     // Other fields
   };
   ```

### API Changes

1. **Update Session Creation API:**
   - Ensure all form fields are properly passed to the database
   - Preserve individual timestamps for each seal tag
   - Store operator information with each seal tag

2. **Update Session Retrieval API:**
   - Return complete information including text values and operator details
   - Ensure seal tag images are properly returned

### UI Changes

1. **Update Session Details Page:**
   - Display Registration Certificate text value
   - Display Driver License text value
   - Show seal tag images
   - Display accurate timestamps for each seal tag
   - Show actual operator names instead of generic "Operator" label

2. **Add PDF Export Functionality:**
   - Add a PDF export button for non-employee users
   - Ensure the exported PDF includes all session details, driver information, and seal tags

## Implementation Approach

1. **Database Updates:**
   - Modify the Prisma schema to include the new fields
   - Run migrations to update the database structure
   - Consider data migration for existing records

2. **Backend Updates:**
   - Modify API endpoints to store and retrieve the additional data
   - Ensure proper validation and error handling

3. **Frontend Updates:**
   - Update the Session Details page to display the additional information
   - Implement the PDF export functionality
   - Test with different user roles to ensure appropriate access

## Testing Plan

1. **Database Testing:**
   - Verify schema changes are applied correctly
   - Check existing data integrity after migration

2. **API Testing:**
   - Validate that all fields are properly passed to the database
   - Ensure correct retrieval of all data

3. **UI Testing:**
   - Verify all information is displayed correctly
   - Test PDF export functionality
   - Validate user role permissions

## Conclusion

Addressing these issues will significantly improve the usability and integrity of the Session Details page. By ensuring all operator-captured data is properly stored and displayed, we enhance the platform's value for verification, compliance, and audit purposes.
